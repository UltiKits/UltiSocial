 * key that is <em>missing</em>, so an existing install keeps the key, keeps whatever value the
 * operator gave it, and gets no indication that the value means nothing. This class is that
 * indication -- one warning per leftover key, naming the module, the file and the key, and saying
 * what became of the setting.
